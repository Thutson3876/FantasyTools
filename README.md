# FantasyTools
Minecraft 1.17+ plugin designed to add fantasy RPG elements and progression through the use of special tools. Each class has 4 traits that can be leveled up and utilized for unique gameplay mechanics. 

# How to Use
While holding a tool, type the command "/register" in order to turn it into an unbreakable class tool. 
This will allow the user to use the command "/leveluptrait <trait>" in order to obtain/increase the effects of a trait on their tool. 
The traits are displayed on the tool itself, and information about each trait can be found by using the command "/traitinfo <trait>" ("/classinfo <class>" will give a broad overview of the class and its abilities). 
Skillpoints are obtained whenever a non-crafting related achievement is obtained. For example, a first mob kill will grant a skillpoint, but crafting an iron pickaxe will not. 
All data is saved to the tool itself, so upon disconnecting and reconnecting, you must re-register your tool
